## Overview

This project is a solution to the Huddle landing page with single introductory section challenge on Frontend Mentor. It was built with HTML and CSS and it is 100% static. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and active states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Converting Colors](https://convertingcolors.com/) - Particullarly I like to call the colors on my CSS code by its HEX code (not always the best choice though). This website converts the code for you from any format you have to any format you like. By now, it is my favorite.
